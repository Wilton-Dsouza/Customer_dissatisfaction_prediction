# Customer Dissatisfaction Prediction

When a consumer chooses not to use a company's services anymore, that is called customer turnover. Businesses regularly analyze their customer turnover since knowing which customers are on the verge of leaving is incredibly beneficial to them. The goal of this project is to leverage the data already available to train a machine learning model 
that will accurately anticipate which customers are going to leave a firm, enabling the business owner to make more informed marketing decisions
